# If_statements
If statement in Python

This project created by me (Tamim Shamal) on 11/4/10.
If you are a Green River student or you are taking 'Intro to Python'
it is unethical for you to use this code for anything other than a guideline.  
I have been asked by my professor to note this fact.  Please do not copy this
code directly for your class, nor make minor alterations and then submit.

Consider this aid over a solution.  Besides you grow more when you do the work.

Thanks for checking out my work, and let's keep coding!
